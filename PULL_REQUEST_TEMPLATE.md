When submitting a Pull Request upstream it's important to ensure:
- [ ] All linting is passing
- [ ] All unit tests are passing
- [ ] All end-to-end tests are passing
- [ ] Any new functionality has 100% coverage (including branches)
- [ ] Any new dependencies etc are pinned (i.e. `new_lib==0.0.1`)

For new functionality it's important that if you're not contributing towards one of the project milestones that you describe
the value of the functionality to the end user.
